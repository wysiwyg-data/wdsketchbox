# wdSketchBox version 1.0.1 bug fix - August 2024
=================================================


## `elementSize()` method fix
Previously the **width** and **height** attributes of the canvas were hardcoded to **800** and **600** respectively.

These attributes are now set to the value of the options `drawElementWidth` and `drawElementHeight` respectively.
